    <h2>💻Technologies Used</h2>
    <p>
      This application was developed using IntelliJ IDEA for server-side code and Visual Studio Code for front-end development. PostgreSQL was used to create and manage the database, storing travel product items and other relevant data. Postman was utilized for testing and validating API endpoints.
<br /> <br />
The backend was built with the Spring Framework, providing a robust and scalable server architecture, while Vue.js was implemented on the front end to create a responsive and interactive user experience.

    <h2>💭Reflection and Feedback</h2>
    <p>Back-end development was very new for me when I started the bootcamp at <a href="https://techelevator.com/" alt="tech elevator">Tech Elevator</a>, so this was a bit of a challenge! And at the end of the course, I was one of six selected to present this application to my cohort at <a href="https://techelevator.com/" alt="tech elevator">Tech Elevator!</a> I loved designing the application - creating the layout and considering how to make this readable and user friendly. It was certainly a challenge to have the back-end interact with the front-end code, however, overcoming this challenge was absolutely one of my favorite achievements in this application. <br /> <br /> As I continue to work on this project, I am considering a few changes and additions, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>An "About" button on the top with the navigation for easier access to users</li>
      <li>Edit the styling for the log in and registration page to accommodate to the webpage</li>
      <li>Add a feature to the cart icon to show there are items in the cart</li>
      <li>Allow authenticated users to edit their profile and information</li>
      <li>Feature a preview of the travel blog for users to know what they will subscribe to</li>
      <li>Create a checkout page after authenticated users completed adding items to their shopping cart</li>
    </ul>
    Happy to hear your thoughts! <br /> <br />
